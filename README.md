# linux-ufw-firewall-demo
This project demonstrates how to configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on a Linux system. It includes steps to view existing rules, block insecure ports (e.g., Telnet on port 23), allow secure services (e.g., SSH on port 22), and remove rules to restore default settings.
